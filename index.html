		<h3>...interviewed by Ryan Song</h3>

		<p>Today, I had the pleasure of interviewing Chris Yang. We met in MarrCoolidge, the legendary dorm of freshmen boys.</p>

<h2>What is your favorite food? Why?</h2>

<p>I like a lot of food … hmm. Now, if I have to choose, I would choose a big juicy steak, because I just love beef period. Mac’n Cheese would be a very close second though.</p>


<h2>What is your favorite music? Why do you like it?</h2>

<p>I like music from ‘the weeknd’. I guess it’s mostly because they have very catchy tunes, and it gets me pumped whenever I hear his music.</p>


<h2>What is your favorite vacation place?  Do you have any specific memories that you can share?</h2>

<p>Maldives would be the first by a quite big margin. One memory I give will be empathized by all the people who like to relax. In Maldives, you get to lie on the beach in the warm sun, relaxing as much as you can ever relax.</p>


<h2>What is one thing in the world that you would like to accomplish (when you are older?)</h2>

<p>Become a multi billionaire. Becoming a billionaire would be proof that I have lived a resourceful life, and that I have been smart to make good decisions until that point. I understand that being a billionaire does involve unpleasant experiences, being targeted as an enemy in the political/economic world, but the respect that I will get is enough to suffice that danger.</p>


<h2>What is one thing in the world that you would like to change?</h2>

<p>I would like to end violence, terrorism, and I would like to start with Syria, which we are dealing with in Global Seminar class. Another reason I want to become a billionaire.</p>


<h2>What is one thing in the world that makes you most happy?</h2>

<p>I think soccer is one of those things that just makes me happy. I don’t have to score goals. I don’t have to be the MVP of a match. Soccer still makes me happy.</p>
